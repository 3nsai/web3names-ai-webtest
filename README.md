# README.md for Test Cases and Playwright Scripts

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Web3Names AI Web Test** repository! This document provides step-by-step instructions for our interns on how to create test cases and automate them using Playwright. Follow these guidelines carefully to ensure comprehensive testing of our application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- **Testcases**: This folder is where you will store all generated test cases.
- **Playwright Scripts**: This folder is designated for the automation scripts written in Playwright.

## Part 1: Creating Test Cases from Documentation

### Step 1: Extract Information from Documentation

1. **Choose a Feature**: Start with one feature or section of the documentation (e.g., Login Page).
2. **Include Screenshots**: Use the provided screenshots and write a brief description of each (e.g., "This screenshot shows the login fields: Email and Password.").

### Step 2: Use GPT to Generate Test Cases

1. **Gather Inputs**: For each section, describe the inputs, user actions, and expected results.
2. **Craft Your Prompt**: Use a prompt similar to the following:
```

I have a screenshot of a login page with two fields: "Email" and "Password," and a "Login" button.
The expected behavior is:

- Users enter their email and password.
- When they click "Login," they are redirected to the dashboard if the credentials are valid.
- If credentials are invalid, an error message appears: "Invalid email or password."
  Generate test cases covering:
- Happy path
- Error cases
- Edge cases
- Usability cases

```

3. **Review Generated Test Cases**: Ensure they include:
- Test Case ID
- Title
- Preconditions
- Steps to Reproduce
- Expected Outcome
- Priority

### Step 3: Iterate Section by Section

1. **Repeat Process**: Continue extracting information and generating test cases for each section of the documentation.
2. **Organize Test Cases**: Store them in the **Testcases** folder, organized by features/pages.

### Step 4: Ensure Comprehensive Coverage

1. **Expand Scenarios**: Use GPT to generate additional test cases for edge scenarios (e.g., refreshing the page, clicking "Login" without inputs).
2. **Sample Prompt for Edge Cases**:

```

Add test cases for edge scenarios:

- User refreshes the page after entering valid inputs.

````

### Step 5: Finalize and Store Test Cases

- Save all generated test cases in a Google Document or directly in the **Testcases** folder.

## Part 2: Automating Test Cases Using Playwright

### Step 1: Set Up the Automation Environment

1. **Install Playwright**:
```bash
npm install @playwright/test
````

2. **Initialize Playwright**:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

### Step 2: Translate Test Cases into Playwright Scripts

1. **Use GPT for Script Generation**: Provide details of your test case to GPT using a prompt like this:

   ```
   Based on the following test case, generate a Playwright test script:
   Test Case:
   - Title: Verify successful login with valid credentials
   ```

2. **Review Generated Scripts**: Ensure they follow proper syntax and structure.

### Step 3: Run Automated Tests

- Execute all Playwright tests with the following command:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```

### Step 4: Debug and Refine Tests

1. Use Playwright Trace Viewer or console logs to debug any failing tests.
2. Update your scripts based on findings from manual testing or new edge cases.

## Additional Notes for Interns

- When generating test cases, include common user interactions (e.g., refreshing pages, invalid data).
- Always use `await` before Playwright actions (e.g., `await page.click()`).
- Prefer using stable selectors like `data-testid` attributes for better reliability.
